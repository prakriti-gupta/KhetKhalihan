Smart irrigation system.

## Idea
In this era , the major problem our environment is facing is inappropriate climatic conditions 
for plants to grow healthy. So our idea is to develop  Smart Irrigation System  based on IoT. 
The main motive is to build a system for monitoring a crop field with the help of sensors 
(light , moisture , humidity , temperature , etc.) and automating the irrigation system . 
Cultivatorists can monitor the field conditions from anywhere via our website. After monitoring , 
our system will analyse the data and manage the parameters by its own. This will be achieved as
(temperature can be controlled by fan, moisture level in soil can be controlled by water pump and control
of sunlight can be managed through roof automatically ).

## Technology Stack
